I am Tran Minh Nhat (last, middle and first name) from Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. I am learning with honor program in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at the Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology.

I am currently learning on Embedded System, Signal Processing and Machine Learning.

I am looking to collaborate on the road toward Embedded Expert.

## Acedemic Projects

### Image Forgery Classification and Segmentation: A Unified Deep-Learning Approach
* **Time**: 2021

* **Role**: Leader of a team with two members.

* **Description**: We proposed a unified deep-learning network which can perform classification and
segmentation simultaneously. Besides, we also derived a loss function for overcoming data imbalance.

* **Result**: In comparison, there are two tasks. The proposed method surpasses recent methods (up to 2018) for 3/5 public datasets on task1, and 5/5 public datasets on task2.

### Image Forgery Detection using Deep Learning
[https://github.com/thuyngch/Image-Forgery-using-Deep-Learning](https://github.com/thuyngch/Image-Forgery-using-Deep-Learning)
* **Time**: Sep 2020-Feb 2021
* **Role**: Leader of a team with 3 members.
* **Description**: This was a research contract with HCMUT. My team had researched on Deep Learning
techniques applied for Image Forgery Detection problem.
* **Result**: Our model can detect forged images with high accuracy of 95.1%

### Face Attendance Checking System (Sep 2021 – Feb 2022)
* **Role**: Member of a team with 3 members.
* **Description**: My team had designed an Attendance Checking application using face to distinguish
individuals.
* **Result**: The algorithm can be run realtime on popular laptops (in CPU mode). It is also accurate at 96.5%

## Event Information Extraction from Flyers
[https://github.com/thuyngch/Event-info-extraction-from-flyers](https://github.com/thuyngch/Event-info-extraction-from-flyers)
* **Time**: Sep 2017 – Oct 2017
* **Role**: Algorithm development.
* **Description**: This was a project with 2 classmates in the course ”Digital Image Processing”. Our work was reading a paper from the Standford university and then realizing it into code.
* **Result**: A Matlab GUI extracting important information of events as text (e.g. time and location) from poster or flyer images.

## Iris Recognition
[https://github.com/thuyngch/Iris-Recognition](https://github.com/thuyngch/Iris-Recognition)
* **Time**: Jun 2017 – Dec 2017
* **Role**: Leader of a team with 6 members.
* **Description**: My team had conducted a research on Iris Recognition to recognize identities of people by using their iris images.
* **Result**: Two versions of Iris Recognition application in both Python and Matlab. An MIT-license repository is published in GitHub and received many interests from the community.
